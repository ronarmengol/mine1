          <div class="col-lg-8 intro">

            <p>I am currently residing in <i><em>Copperbelt, Kitwe</em>. </i> I am a web development enthusiast. If you are here to ask about web development or maybe you want to make some improvements to your site you have come to the right place.</p>
            <p>There are many website builders online now. These are drag and drop, do-it-yourself builders where you can build websites without any code. I want to learn how to code, and coding cannot be learned by using website builders. The best one is WordPress, in fact many developers in Zambia use WordPress to build websites. This has a steep learning curve compared to the others and you may need some basic coding.</p>
            <p>If you want to set your course on web design then some of the rising stars are the likes of Wix, Squarespace, Blogger, Webflow, these are just a few of the many. I believe. If you are in <em>Kitwe, Ndola, Lusaka</em>, anywhere in <em>Zambia</em>, you can access these builders. However, I would advise you do so with a laptop, I don't think you can build on a mobile device because the screen would be too small to develop optimally. </p>
            <p>Web development is just a part of digital marketing. Some agencies can do the full Kaboodle, however, I will be sticking to web design. Below is a small table of tools available to a modern marketeer.</p>

        <div class="col-lg-8">
          <p>Many people use the words <i>web designer</i> and web developer interchangeably. Let me add a little clarity on the difference.</p>   
          <p>The web designer specialises more on the look, design and the layout of the website and it's user experience. He uses his skills to attract, inform and persuade clients. He is adept in graphics software programs like Photoshop, where he enhances, manipulates images and text. The web developer on the other hand translates these designs into code which the computer can understand. He deploys the website into a hosting company and registers it with a search engine and optimizes the website for search engine search (SEO). The person who can design a webpage but cannot write or understand code is a graphic designer.</p>

              <h2>11 REASONS WHY YOU NEED A WEBSITE FOR YOUR BUSINESS</h2>
              <br />
              <h2>1. Customer expectation</h2>
              <h2 style="display: none;">web designer developer zambia</h2>
              <p>
                We are in the 21st century, your tech-minded and
                mobile-conscious customers are expecting more and more now for
                businesses to have a website so that they can find out more
                about them online.
              </p>

              <h2>2. Control your brand</h2>
              <h2 style="display: none;">web designer developer zambia</h2>
              <p>
                A website acts as a platform that you can shape a favourable
                perception of your business in a way that social media cannot
                provide. In particular protecting yourself from being reviewed
                unknowingly and/or negatively from damaging and hostile
                comments.<br />
                79% of users who read online reviews, believe them. Reduce that
                negativity by posting your own positive testimonials.

      <h2>Cost of building up a website</h2>
      <p>There are 3 main costs to starting up your website: the web designer, the domain name and hosting.</p>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-8">
          <h3>Web designer / developer</h3>
         <p>
           You have plenty of choice when choosing a web developer or designer. First you must decide to choose a payment package, where the agency (<a href="./blogs/freelancer-vs-agency.html" style="color: #c83e4d; " title="agency vs freelancer">agency vs freelancer</a>) will charge you either per hour or on job completion. You can hire web developers from the internet (upwork), where the average rate in $20 an hour. Personally this is a tricky choice, as the time frame of finishing is uncertain hence making the finish cost unpredictable.
         </p>
         <p>
            I would suggest for the cost of the finished product. Informational/corporate websites average about K5000. E-commerce sites go above K13000. Many websites in Zambia are designed with WordPress. Generally, websites that are made in Lusaka are most costly than the ones made in the Copperbelt.
         </p>  
         <h3>Domain name</h3>
          <p>Your website must have a domain name. This is the reference point for your website in the internet. It is basically a web address. Domain names cost between $5 to $20 a year. These domain names are subject to availability. You can purchase them from the internet like Namecheap.com, or you can purchase them from a local host in Zambia. Once you have a domain name, you then choose a domain extension, the popular extension is dot com (.com). The extension is personal preference there are many. However, if you have noticed, I am using the .netlify.app extension.</p>
          <h3>Web hosting</h3>
          <p>Web hosting is the facility of hosting your website in internet. Local hosting charges vary, I have seen some starter rates at K230 per month, some K1400 if you pay for the full year.</p>
          <p>You have many choices. If you want cheap rates they are out there. And you can upgrade once your business grows. Upgraded versions means serving the data faster.</p>
          <p id="bandwidth">One thing to keep your eye out is on the <b><i>bandwidth</i></b> the hosting company offers. They normally charge extra if you exceed the bandwidth for a particular hosting package. Let me illustrate, if you expect 20 visitors a day and let's say the average website page is 1.5MB (mega bytes - size of your website file stored in the hosting company) : in 30 days your bandwidth consumption will be : 20 visitors * 30 days * 1.5MB = 900MB. Normal start packages are 500MB. If you are starting, make sure you optimize your website and keep the number of images down.</p>
          <p>See my <a style="color: #c83e4d;" href="#web-price">web price offer</a>. I can offer an amazing price to get you started.</p>
          <p>
            Design here plays an important role on bandwidth consumption. Too many images will burn bandwidth in no time.
          </p>

      <h2>How to make a website</h2>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-8">
          <p>First: you need a text editor. You can even start with Notepad, but do not use Word, programming uses different words and syntax and you will get tons of corrections. I use VScode. It is an integrated development environment (IDE). This is amazing for developers because it checks the code before compile time. There are others, like Atom, sublime, the choice is up to you. </p>
          <p>The three languages you need to learn are HTML, CSS and a little Javascript. (not Java)</p>
          <p>HTML is the chassis, the skeletal backbone, the content of the webpage. It is possible to make a webpage from HTML alone, but that would be pretty boring. CSS (cascading style sheets) this language as it suggests 'styles' your HTML elements. CSS has improved so much you can do some animation outside Javascript. Javascript provides program logic which HTML and CSS cannot do.</p>
          <p>If you are new to programming, or new to HTML, CSS and javascript, you must practise and design until you become accustomed to the syntax (grammar) of the languages so the program works accordingly. Miss a comma, semi colon, and even a mispelling the program won't work.</p>
          <p>Master your syntax, as you do this, and you will make tons of mistakes, from there you will learn basic debugging (finding program problems, and correcting them), and believe me, programs will get much more complicated.</p>

              Pro tip: do not memorize everything, most programmers cannot memorize the thousands of commands available. Learn how to use them and these tools as you need them.
            </p> 
          </div>

          <p>Don't worry when you feel that you are spending more time staring at the screen than bashing in some code into your computer. You will spend considerable amount of time problem solving.</p>

      <h2>Learn a framework</h2>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-8">
          <h3>Bootstrap</h3>
          <p>CSS has a large library of commands. I do not design layouts with CSS, it is time consuming and tricky. This is where Bootstrap reduces development time by incorporating code that is easy to implement. When you use Bootstrap your code design is cleaner and easier to manage.</p>
          <p>Bootstrap is the most popular CSS framework. There are other CSS frameworks like Tailwind and postCSS.</p>
          <p>The alpha version of Bootstrap 5 came out in July 2020. Some of the big changes are: JQuery has been phased out, and it will not support Internet Explorer (IE).</p>

      <h2>Learn basic typography</h2>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-8">
            <p>Typography has to do with text design is presented on the webpage. The 'h1' tag is very important for SEO. Ensure one keyword is placed in an h1 tag. Use the 'h1' tag sparingly it should be used as a title for the webpage. Use the smaller headers for subtitles 'h2' to 'h6'. A common trend with titles is the lesser it becomes the smaller the font size. You can also use lower opacity to contrast from the greater title headers.</p>
            <p>Use a minimum of two fonts on your page design. One for the titles and the other for the content.</p>
            <p>Exercise care when you put text on images. Often times the text is difficult to read because of a low contrast value between the text and the image. In Google chrome tools you will score lowly on the accessibility score.</p>
            <p>Do not use too many colours. Web designers use a maximum of 5 different palettes per page.</p>
            <p>Make a provision also for your text to be read on mobile devices. Web designers suggest a 1.5 - 1.7 rem font size for content text. </p>
            <p>When you prepare slabs of text for the bigger screens either use 2 - 3 columns for reading text. If you decide to use one columns reduce the max-width to 600 - 700px wide. It is common practise that text should not read the full width of a big screen.</p>
            <p>Interrupt chunks of text with images, tables, charts, clippart, symbols, or the page will be boring and monotonous.</p>

      <h2>Web Development</h2>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-8">
          <p>If you have finished your master design .. a big well done. I believe this is a personal choice: you can launch your website now for all to see, or prepare SEO for the web site. It's finished, so why not?</p>
          <p>Opinions vary. I believe once the website is visually finished. It should be registered with google and launched, because it takes time for the website to be registered and ranked with google. </p>
          <p>If you or your website developer have registered your website, you should be able to find it online by putting the URL address into the address bar of the browser. Or you can go into google search and write ..site:'your URL address'.</p>
          <p>Indexing can take time. It can take even up to 2 weeks.</p>
          <p>While google is resolving the indexing we need to resolve 3 behind the scenes issues, so our website can rank in the future.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Website responsiveness</li>
            <li>Website speed</li>
            <li>Website SEO</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-4">

      <h3>Website responsiveness</h3>
      <div class="row">
        
        <div class="col-lg-2">
          <img loading="lazy" src="./assets/img/zambia-1.png" alt="zambia responsive" title="responsive">
        </div>


        <div class="col-lg-8">
          <p>This is not about how fast the website is, but rather its responsiveness to different viewports like mobile devices. Developers create their websites on laptops or large screens, but they have to make designs as to how the website will look on a mobile device.</p>
          <p>If the website is not mobile optimized it will take on two possible looks. One, the images and the text will shrink to fit into the mobile device, this will make the text and images too small to read and appreciate.</p>
          <p>The second look: will be the images will be cropped and text will be overflowing on the horizontal axis. The user has to scroll left and right to read the text and see the complete image. This is not a pleasant user experience.</p>
          <p>This can be solved by using a grid layout and media queries breakpoints. The responsive grid layout will force the content that is stacked horizontally to be stacked vertically. So there will be no need for the user to scroll left and right. Media queries, is a css function that can test the width of the viewport, if the viewport is the size of a mobile device, it can instruct the browser to load a mobile version of the image.</p>

              Webpage responsiveness is a Google ranking factor

      </div>


      <h3>Website speed</h3>
      
      <div class="row">

        <div class="col-lg-2">
          <img loading="lazy" src="./assets/img/zambia-2.png" alt="zambia responsive" title="responsive">
        </div>

        <div class="col-lg-8">
          <p>This is obvious. No one likes a slow website.</p>
          <p>Not only do we need to get into Google's good book, website studies around the world have shown that client's leave websites that take too long to load</p>
          <p>Studies have shown that slow websites give an impression that it is not professionally made and the download speed is the first experience a visitor has over the website.</p>
          <p>As a developer you are probably using at least 4G speeds to test and build your program, dont forget to take into account that the majority of people are using 3G on their mobile devices this means your program can take 3 times longer to download on their phones.</p>
          <p>Some things you must resolve in program design to increase web speed:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>defer render blocking scripts</li>
            <li>remove unused scripts</li>
            <li>put all scripts in one file to reduce redirects</li>
            <li>use correct image formats</li>
            <li>use correct image sizes</li>
            <li>compress images</li>
          <li>use media queries to select correct sized images for different screent sizes and aspect ratios</li>
          <li>check for errors in the console</li>
          <li>switch of auto play if you have videos</li>
          <li>delay loading images that are under the fold</li>
          <li>minify HTML, CSS and Javascript</li>
          <li>Purge the CSS (do this cautiously)</li>
          <li>prefetch 3rd party sources that will be used in later</li>
          <li>minimize 3rd party downloads like imported fonts</li>
          
        </ul>
        </div>
      </div>


      <h3>SEO search engine optimization</h3>

      <div class="row">

        <div class="col-lg-2">
          <img loading="lazy" src="./assets/img/zambia-3.png" alt="zambia responsive" title="responsive">
        </div>

        <div class="col-lg-8">
        <p>SEO is the implementation of methods and design practises that follow search engine guidelines for a website to rank optimally. Organic search, is ranking in the search engine for particular keywords without the use of paid ads.</p>
        <p>I have deliberately covered website responsiveness and website speed before SEO, because the two are important ranking factors for SEO design.</p>

        <p>Google does not rank pretty websites. However, if you have an ugly website, it can reflect badly on your company image or profile.</p>
        <p>Use images sparingly, and if you use them ensure you use the correct format and they are optimized. Images beautify your website, and they also increase file size. This means higher <a style="color: #c83e4d;" href="#bandwidth">bandwidth</a> and slower download times.</p>
        <p>Actionable SEO:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Fill in the title tag</li>
          <li>Fill in the description tag</li>
          <li>Fill in the keywords tag (optional)</li>
          <li>Fill in the robot.txt meta tag</li>
          <li>Make sure h1 tag has a keyword</li>
          <li>Some h2 and h3 tags have keywords</li>
          <li>First 100 words must have keyword</li>
          <li>Images must have alt descriptions, titles and file names</li>
          <li>Content must have 2-3% keyword density</li>
          <li>Industry related keywords</li>
          <li>Backlinks</li>
          <li>External links</li>
          <li>Internal links</li>
          <li>A robot.txt file</li>
          <li>A sitemap.xml</li>
