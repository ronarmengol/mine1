                    <h1>10 points that make an amazing website</h1>
                    <br>
                    <h2>1. Attractive home page</h2>
                    <p>The home page or the front page is the first page that potential customers see. It must be amazing. People will soon leave if they perceive your website is old, boring and amateur.</p>

                    <h2>2. Complete, quality content</h2>
                    <p>There are many websites similar to yours. Stand out from the rest, have interesting fresh and better content! You must be having readers asking for more. And most importantly provide information customers are searching for. Anticipate and exhaust all their questions leaving little room in their minds to check out another website. </p>
                    
                    <h2>3. Fast download</h2>
                    <p>There are studies in the web that webpages that take too long to download will be bounced. Web pages must be optimized so the programming code gets processed faster and reduces the lag on the user interface, leaving a satisfied user experience. </p>

                    <h2>4. Fresh, up to date content</h2>
                    <p>Information is changing so fast. Care must be taken to update and change the website to inform clients of any new products and changes the company makes. Update frequently and give the best information at all times.</p>

                    <h2>5. Responsiveness</h2>
                    <p>Responsiveness is not how fast a website loads on to your device. In web design, responsiveness has to do with how the web page reacts to changes in the viewport a.k.a. the viewing screen size. This simply means that content is stacked vertically and the user does not need to scroll left and right for content that has overflowed outside the screen size.</p>

                    <h2>6. Mobile friendly</h2>
                    <p>
                        This is important as most people view websites over their mobile devices rather than their desktop computers and laptops.
                    </p>

                    <h2>7. Grammar and spelling</h2>
                    <p>
                        Improper idioms, misspellings and grammatical mistakes will make the website appear amateur. Poor use of language will lead to misunderstanding and break trust.
                    </p>

                    <h2>8. Multimedia</h2>
                    <p>
                        Dont bore your readers with a giant slab of text. Implement all the tools at your disposal: fonts, colours, text sizes, images, videos, infographics and animation. The longer your reader stays on your webpage, the longer lasting impression he will have over your business even when he has long left.
                    </p>

                    <h2>9. Remove unnecessary distractions</h2>
                    <p>Excessive adverts, and annoying popups should be avoided. It hurts user experience. Help the clients to focus on product and service information</p>

                    <h2>10. SEO - search engine optimization</h2>
                    <p>Your website must be indexed with Google, without which your pretty website will not be discoverable. Implement on page SEO and put LSI keywords in your content. Google is getting smarter, it wont rank your page well if you put 'cake vendor' 1000 times. Insert the right keywords relevant to your business!</p>
