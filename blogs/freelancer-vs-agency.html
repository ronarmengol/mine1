               <h1>Why you should get a web free lancer</h1>
                <br>
                <h2>1. Price</h2>
                <p>This is an obvious one. Free lancers are much cheaper. This is because they do not have the enormous overheads of an agency. An agency has to pay for their office, studio, and workforce, transport costs for employees and all the other miscellaneous expenses that take to run a full time business. Even though there is no work the bills are high and unavoidable. Most freelancers work from home.</p>

                <h2>2. One on one communication</h2>
                <p>The personal attention a free lancer will give you. You should be able to ask him about design, problems with the code, and SEO. When you work with an agency you may have to deal with varying people according to their expertise.</p>

                <h2>3. They can finish the work faster</h2>
                <p>Full time free lancers can finish the work faster. The work of content writers has to be revised afterwards by seo copywriters. Freelancers understand the importance of SEO as they write up the content. Too many people can increase complexity.</p>
                


                <h1>Why you should NOT get a free lancer</h1>
                <h2>1. Do not have specialised skills</h2>
                <p>Agencies say, a freelancer cannot be a jack of all trades. It is not possible for one man, to design a web site, code the web site, do the content writing, seo copywriting, doing the website deployment. These are specialised skills</p>
                
                <h2>2. Slower to finish</h2>
                <p>Some free lancers design part time, this means they only work on your project when they get back home from their regular work.</p>
                <p>In an agency one department can work on SEO, at the same time another department can work on design.</p>

                <h2>Website developers don't have marketing experience</h2>
                <p>Website designers can make nice websites but they may make websites that are out of touch with the business and the customers. They do not have the time to study the needs of the business.</p>

                <h2>Time zone</h2>
                <p>Some people hire web designers from other countries with different time zones. How will you commuicate when one is sleeping and the other is up and about?</p>

                <h2>Free lancers don't know anything about SEO</h2>
                <p></p>

                <h1>Final choice</h1>
                <p>Entry level work should be given to the freelancers. Small businesses, and start ups should try the cheaper option.</p>
                <p>Large websites that require specialist attention should use agencies. A growing business will need an agency. Agencies will be able to offer better and larger range of digital services.</p>
