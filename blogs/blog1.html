                 <h1>11 REASONS WHY YOU NEED A WEBSITE FOR YOUR BUSINESS</h1>
                 <br>
                 <h2>1. Customer expectation</h2>
                 <p>We are in the 21st century, your tech-minded and mobile-conscious customers are expecting more and more now for  businesses to have a website so that they can find out more about them online.</p>
                 
                 <h2>2. Control your brand</h2>
                 <p>A website acts as a platform that you can shape a favourable perception of your business in a way that social media cannot provide. In particular protecting yourself from being reviewed unknowingly and/or negatively from damaging and hostile comments.<br>
                 79% of users who read online reviews, believe them. Reduce that negativity by posting your own positive testimonials.</p>
                    
                 <h2>3. Easy to start</h2>
                 <p>You do not need to be tech literate; we can design and put your web page out there, so you can focus on running your day to day operations. We are here to help optimize content clearly and concisely for your target clients.</p>
                    
                 <h2>4. Instant credibility</h2>
                 <p>First impressions count, and websites allow you to make a very strong impression with a well designed introduction for your business. A good website instantly boosts your credibility as a genuine business, a business who is making efforts in keeping up with the times. Creating a contemporary and updated perception from your users.</p>
                    
                 <h2>5. You will save time</h2>
                 <p>Engaging with potential customers takes time: introducing your business, offering product lists and advantages of your product will take valuable time. Your website can save you that time by providing answers to common customer questions and queries. This means you can spend more time attending to about-to-be-buyers and less time with clients who are browsing or 'window-shopping'.</p>
                    
                 <h2>6. 24hrs Around the clock</h2>
                 <p>The internet allows consumers to literally shop online around-the-clock. The only way businesses can reach all of their potential customers is to have a good business web design that will allow them to shop or research the company any hour of the day. Imagine prospective clients reading your web content overnight while we are all sleeping - this would not be possible without a website.</p>

                 <h2>7. Attract new customers</h2>
                 <p>One of the top reasons for a professional web design is the potential to attract new customers. As consumers surf the internet, they will have access to the businesses products, services or information, where otherwise they may not have even known the business existed.  You may find prospects in multiple stages of the sales process, meaning you may find researchers, comparers or purchasers.  Make sure to have an offer for all of them.</p>

                 <h2>8. Show case your products.</h2>
                 <p>A well designed and information filled website, will effectively put all your products and services in a controlled and favourable light. It will create awareness for your product or brand which the reader has never tried or heard of before. Your website will bring legitimacy to your service and eliminate the 'fake' or not genuine perception. </p>

                 <h2>9. Further reach.</h2>
                 <p>Your physical presence maybe local, but your well made web page can help your products and services be known provincially, nationally or even globally.</p>

                 <h2>10. It is greener.</h2>
                 <p>For the environmentally conscious, the website reduces human kinds' carbon foot-print. People don't need to drive their vehicles to research your business. Businesses spend less money on printed material and flyers. Let's save and protect our trees by doing our part.</p>
                 
                 <h2>11. Improve customer service</h2>
                 <p>A website is a fantastic avenue to provide value added service to your customers and clients, and is an amazing way to keep them coming back to you when they need your products or services. <br>
                    <br>
                 Build rapport and good will: you can share tips with your customers on how to use or care for the products they’ve purchased from you. If it is pharmacetical products, you can provide tips on dosage, nutrition, rest, to effect optimal recovery for their customers. <br>

                 If you offer a service, such as accounting, you can provide your clients valuable advice to help them pay less tax at tax time or how to simplify their bookkeeping. Or if you’re in insurance, you could give advice on how to choose the right insurance policy for theirs or their family’s needs. <br>
                    <br>
                 By adding a resource section(FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions), you can regularly add articles to answer all your customers’ questions and you can keep them better informed and up-to-date.</p>
