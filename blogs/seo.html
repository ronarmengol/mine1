            <h1>SEO - Search Engine optimization <span style="display: none;">Zambia Copperbelt Ndola Kitwe Lusaka</span> </h1>

            <br />
            <p>Search engine optimization is the practise of methods that will bring organic traffic to your website. Organic traffic is funneling the browser users to your website without the use of Google ads. This is an amazing policy. If Google had allowed ranking to be based on monetary ad spend, no small website will ever compete against the mega companies who have million dollar marketing spends.</p>
            <h2>Why is SEO so important?</h2>
            <h2 style="display: none">SEO importance</h2>
            <p>
              I understand many people just want a website. A pretty website to inform people about their goods and services. People want an online presence where they can control the narrative. Google does not rank good looking websites. If you want to make your to website rank in Google's search algorithms or formula, there are certain guidelines that needs to be adhered to. This means your amazing website may never be found.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you do decide to have your own website, do not only plan to build a beautiful functional site, but consider strongly the after production SEO. You will waste money and your time if your website cannot be found.
            </p>
            <h2>Graphic design</h2>
            <p>
              The first stage of web development is the graphic design process. The client gives some guidelines to the designer what kind of website he/she wants. What is the theme or purpose of the website. What are the main colour palettes that should be used? Should the designer create a company logo? What images, video, charts and content should be added to the website? This is what some designers call - 'wireframing'. This is to show the client how the final product will look. This includes the sitemap, that is the pages for the website.
            </p>
            <p>
              The graphic designer's main tools are photo editing software like photoshop. The designer, here plans and designs the layout of each page. He has to ensure that the content is organised in a systematic, functional and easy way for newcomers to understand and use.
            </p>
            <h2>Web designer</h2>
            <p>
              When the design has been approved, the next stage is to convert the design into code. The wireframe must be put in a language the web browser can understand. Please note there is a distinction between a web designer and a graphic designer. Both can plan and design a website on paper or on a photo editing software. But graphic designers generally do not know how to code the design into the native language of the browser.
            </p>
            <p>
              The native languages of web browsers are HTML, CSS and Javascript. The most popular browsers are Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Opera and Internet Explorer. The web designer should be familiar with these languages.
            </p>
            <h2>Website builders</h2>
            <p>
              There has been a massive rise in the number of website builders, in the last 10 years. The most well known is Wordpress, which is said to be powering 30% plus of all the websites in the internet. Then comes the drag and drop builders like Wix, Squarespace, Webflow and many others. The drag and drop builders make it easy to create websites without even coding. So much so that you can make one without a web designer or web developer.
            </p>
            <h2>Are web designers and web developers still needed?</h2>
            <p>
              There are still many people out there that have a fear over technology and do not have the personal confidence to try and make their own website, or they simply do not have the time to build and maintain a one.
            </p>
            <p>
              Websites can become extremely complicated. It is good to start with building a simple website with Wix, to have a general idea how websites work. And as your business grows you can then consider hiring a web developer. You will find web builders have their own advantages and limitations.
            </p>

            <h2>Web developer</h2>
            <p>
              Many people use web designer and web developer interchangeably. In one sense they are almost the same. In small businesses and some freelancers they are one and the same thing. Both professionals are able to convert a design concept into code, or simply bring the concept and put it into a website. The web designer is mostly concerned about the content, how it looks, its functionality and user experience. The web designer also has some marketing skills. He must also understand the client's business and people behaviour over the user interface.
            </p>
            <p>
              The web developer can also do the things mentioned above, but is mostly concerned about the website performance. Programming is not just writing hundreds of lines of code, but many developers will tell you, it also involves debugging. This is an unglamorous part of the job finding errors and fixing them. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Web performance is basically all about website speed. The web developer must find ways to refactor code, so it is less bloated, less complicated, easy to understand for the next successor, and faster.
            </p>
            <h2>Website deployment</h2>
            <p>
              The steps needed to deploy your website:
              <br>
              Get a domain name <br>
              Find a hosting company 
            </p>

            <h2>Some interesting facts</h2>
            <p>
              There are over 1.5 billion websites on the internet. <br>

              500,000+ websites are created globally everyday. <br>
              There are 600 million blog sites.
            </p>
            <p>
              20 years ago, it was possible to deploy a website and rank well. Now, there are too many websites in the internet. The question now is how are you going to be found? 
            </p>
            <p>
              I find it more strange that companies that promise to make your website number 1 in google search engine results page (SERP) are not even top 20 for their respective keywords, in fact my own web sites are ranking higher than theirs. SEO is not straight forward. Did you know last year google changed the search algorithm 500 times? Google keeps changing the rules every year. Is that stressful or what?  But these are small changes, to help fine tune the search experience. So is SEO worthwhile if Google keeps changing the goal posts? YES.
            </p>

            <h2>Black hat vs white hat SEO</h2>
            <p>
              I am sure you are wondering why does Google changes their algorithms so frequently? and why some people give up on SEO? Google does not tell anyone what the exact algorithm is! They just tell the webmaster community what they expect a good website should consist off. One important metric is EAT (expertise, authority and trustworthiness). 
            </p>
            <p>
              In the past, I think before 2009. Google would understand a website by keyword density. So webmasters took advantage off this knowledge and stuffed website content with the keywords - this was plain annoying and playing the system. This is black hat SEO, basically trying to trick the system to rank the website. I do not practise black hat SEO. I believe you can rank quickly in the short run, but if Google catches you, you can be penalized severely for a given period of time. So, white hat SEO is following the Google guidelines to help your website rank.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another black hat practise was quantity of content. Webmasters would stuff content into a webpage to rank high on domain authority or on Expertise. The problem with content stuffing was these unscrupulous characters copy and pasted content from other websites to fill up their webpage. Google is much smarter now. Google tests your page for plagiarism - content copying. You will not rank well if you are discovered.
            </p>

            <h2>Keywords</h2>
            <p>
              It is possible to deploy a website into the internet without any SEO. Google would eventually crawl it and index the website into their databases. The question you and your web developer should be asking is how your website should be found. The key is focusing your content and design on the core of your product or service. Once the core is understood, SEO planning can be carefully undertaken.
            </p>
            <p>
              Google is a funny animal. For example I can rank number 5 with on the SERP (search engine results page) with "Kitwe web designer" and rank 12 with "web designer Kitwe." So mix these keywords in your content.
            </p>
            <p>
              You have to anticipate what words the users will use if they are looking for a web designer in a certain locality. You must also understand the use of locality which Google also supports. If a user types "web designer near me" and lives in Kitwe or the Copperbelt, Google will search for web designers closest to the user. It will be unlikely Google will bring out companies from Lusaka.
            </p>

            <h2>Meta tags</h2>
            <p>
              There are three main tags in the head section of your website document. These are important for SEO. They are often forgotten because they are hidden and these tags are unimportant during the test and developing stages of the website build. The first is the title. Normally the default title is document. Here you must give a title about 55-65 characters long. Above that, depending on the characters, it will be truncated in the SERP page. I believe there maybe  a small penalty if it is too long. It may be interpreted that the webmaster is trying to stuff too many words for the sake of ranking. This is straightforward, what is your webpage about. I guess another issue often overlooked, and I am guilty is that each web page must have an exclusive title. I reckon this confuses the search engines if there are duplicate titles and different content.
            </p>
            <p>
              The next most important meta tag on the head document is the description tag. This should be about 160 characters long, after that Google will truncate. The description meta tag tells Google and the human searchers what your website is about. This is especially important for your home page. Two years ago the character length was about 320. It has come back down to 160. The description tag is a summary of your website or webpage. If you are having a blog, or you are having different pages for your goods and services you must also change you meta description tag accordingly. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The title and the description tag cannot be empty. You may not even rank at all. Google cannot index 'nothing'. Also avoid anything offensive, if Google takes your website down, it will be a process to recover your website. (minimum 6 months if you are lucky) 
            </p>
            <p>
              It is important to note that this is not only for Google but also for potential clients who find your website in the SERP page. If your title and description are both tasteless and vague, people will not bother to try and open up your website.
            </p>
            <p>
              Use numbers and dates, and strong emotional words to grab attention, while trying to promote your business. I like putting the year 2020 - it looks up to date and recent. Use numbers like '9 reasons to have a website' and maybe put a special offer in the description tag. By all means hire a marketing specialist to help you maximise on your title and meta description to increase the number of clicks to your website. Add even locality to your keywords if your website is for a locally scoped business.
            </p>

            <h2>Robot tag</h2>
            <p>
              This is a tag which informs the search engine crawlers (googlebots) or spiders to go through and check out your website and index that page in the Google database. If you are not sure, leave the tag content to index. If you put noindex, Google will not index that particular page. Advanced SEO practitioners tweak this for index pages (sitemap page) and contact pages where they feel a particular page has a very weak SEO score and may have a negative effect on the stronger pages they wish to rank for.
            </p>

            <h2>Offpage SEO</h2>
            <h3>Responsiveness</h3>
            <p>
              This has nothing to do about website speed. This is about mobile device friendliness. I believe since 2015, Google has been increasingly emphasising on websites that are compatible with mobile devices. In 2018 the number of websites browsed with mobile devices exceeded the traditional desktop computers and laptops. This seems to be the middle and long term trend.
            </p>
            <p>
              CSS has evolved greatly. In the past it was common for web developers to make a website one for mobile and one for desktops. Now CSS allows programmers to add code for viewports to adjust to different screen sizes. 
            </p>
            <p>
              A mobile friendly screen is one that does not need to scroll left and right because the content is 'overflowing' at the x-axis of the mobile device viewport. 
            </p>
            <h3>Website speed</h3>
            <p>
              This is obvious. No one likes slow websites. This is also a ranking factor. You need a web developer on this side of the program. You need to delay scripts from loading while the browser parses the HTML code. Images must be optimized. Other designs must be employed to give the user a satisfactory and seamless experience. There can be <a href="#bounce-rate">bounce rate</a> implications.
            </p>

            <h2>CONTENT IS KING</h2>
            <p><b>GIVE CUSTOMERS WHAT THEY ARE LOOKING FOR!</b></p>
            <p>
              Produce a good product. If your product is below par, marketing will have a limited impact unless you are a type of monopoly in your sphere of business. Customers must be happy that they come back to your website and even recommend you.
            </p>
            <p>
              One Google EAT metric is Expertise. Google will assume the website that has 5000 words has more content 'expertise' than a website over the same subject matter that has 500 words. I am sure you will agree with me writing an article with 5000 words is not a walk in the park. Let's be honest, the person who wrote a 5000 word article on a particular essay has put on much more effort than the individual who made 500 words.
            </p>
            <p>I would not advise 'stretching' the article, at the end of the day it will be humans who will read the content. Poorly presented content will experience high bounce rates.</p>

            <h2 id="bounce-rate">Bounce rate</h2>
            <p>This is an important SEO factor.</p>
            <p>I understand this to be about how long a user stays on your webpage. If the user stays less than one minute on your website, Google will interpret this that the user has not found what he is looking for; the user is dissatisfied with the content that he found in the website and Google concludes that this website is of low quality and will rank the website down.</p>
            <p>
