            <h1>SEO - Search Engine optimization <span style="display: none;">Zambia Copperbelt Ndola Kitwe Lusaka</span> </h1>

            <br />
            <p>Search engine optimization is the practise of methods that will bring organic traffic to your website. Organic traffic is funneling the browser users to your website without the use of Google ads. This is an amazing policy. If Google had allowed ranking to be based on monetary ad spend, no small website will ever compete against the mega companies who have million dollar marketing spends.</p>
            <h2>Why is SEO so important?</h2>
            <h2 style="display: none">SEO importance</h2>
            <p>
              I understand many people just want a website. A pretty website to inform people about their goods and services. People want an online presence where they can control the narrative. Google does not rank good looking websites. If you want to make your to website rank in Google's search algorithms or formula, there are certain guidelines that needs to be adhered to. This means your amazing website may never be found.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you do decide to have your own website, do not only plan to build a beautiful functional site, but consider strongly the after production SEO. You will waste money and your time if your website cannot be found.
            </p>
            <h2>Graphic design</h2>
            <p>
              The first stage of web development is the graphic design process. The client gives some guidelines to the designer what kind of website he/she wants. What is the theme or purpose of the website. What are the main colour palettes that should be used? Should the designer create a company logo? What images, video, charts and content should be added to the website? This is what some designers call - 'wireframing'. This is to show the client how the final product will look. This includes the sitemap, that is the pages for the website.
            </p>
            <p>
              The graphic designer's main tools are photo editing software like photoshop. The designer, here plans and designs the layout of each page. He has to ensure that the content is organised in a systematic, functional and easy way for newcomers to understand and use.
            </p>
            <h2>Web designer</h2>
            <p>
              When the design has been approved, the next stage is to convert the design into code. The wireframe must be put in a language the web browser can understand. Please note there is a distinction between a web designer and a graphic designer. Both can plan and design a website on paper or on a photo editing software. But graphic designers generally do not know how to code the design into the native language of the browser.
            </p>
            <p>
              The native languages of web browsers are HTML, CSS and Javascript. The most popular browsers are Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Opera and Internet Explorer. The web designer should be familiar with these languages.
            </p>
            <h2>Website builders</h2>
            <p>
              There has been a massive rise in the number of website builders, in the last 10 years. The most well known is Wordpress, which is said to be powering 30% plus of all the websites in the internet. Then comes the drag and drop builders like Wix, Squarespace, Webflow and many others. The drag and drop builders make it easy to create websites without even coding. So much so that you can make one without a web designer or web developer.
            </p>
            <h2>Are web designers and web developers still needed?</h2>
            <p>
              There are still many people out there that have a fear over technology and do not have the personal confidence to try and make their own website, or they simply do not have the time to build and maintain a one.
            </p>
            <p>
              Websites can become extremely complicated. It is good to start with building a simple website with Wix, to have a general idea how websites work. And as your business grows you can then consider hiring a web developer. You will find web builders have their own advantages and limitations.
            </p>

            <h2>Web developer</h2>
            <p>
              Many people use web designer and web developer interchangeably. In one sense they are almost the same. In small businesses and some freelancers they are one and the same thing. Both professionals are able to convert a design concept into code, or simply bring the concept and put it into a website. The web designer is mostly concerned about the content, how it looks, its functionality and user experience. The web designer also has some marketing skills. He must also understand the client's business and people behaviour over the user interface.
            </p>
            <p>
              The web developer can also do the things mentioned above, but is mostly concerned about the website performance. Programming is not just writing hundreds of lines of code, but many developers will tell you, it also involves debugging. This is an unglamorous part of the job finding errors and fixing them. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Web performance is basically all about website speed. The web developer must find ways to refactor code, so it is less bloated, less complicated, easy to understand for the next successor, and faster.
            </p>
            <h2>Website deployment</h2>
            <p>
              The steps needed to deploy your website:
              <br>
              Get a domain name <br>
              Find a hosting company 
            </p>

            <h2>Some interesting facts</h2>
            <p>
              There are over 1.5 billion websites on the internet. <br>

              500,000+ websites are created globally everyday. <br>
              There are 600 million blog sites.
            </p>
            <p>
              20 years ago, it was possible to deploy a website and rank well. Now, there are too many websites in the internet. The question now is how are you going to be found? 
            </p>
            <p>
              I find it more strange that companies that promise to make your website number 1 in google search engine results page (SERP) are not even top 20 for their respective keywords, in fact my own web sites are ranking higher than theirs. SEO is not straight forward. Did you know last year google changed the search algorithm 500 times? Google keeps changing the rules every year. Is that stressful or what? But these are small changes, to help fine tune the search experience. So is SEO worthwhile if Google keeps changing the goal posts? YES.
