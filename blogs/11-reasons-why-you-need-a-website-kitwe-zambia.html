                    <h1>11 REASONS WHY YOU NEED A WEBSITE FOR YOUR BUSINESS</h1>
                    <br />
                    <h2>1. Customer expectation.</h2>
                    <p>
                      We are in the 21st century, your tech-minded and mobile-conscious
                      customers are expecting more and more now for businesses to have a
                      website so that they can find out more about them online.
                    </p>

                    <h2>2. Control your brand.</h2>
                    <p>
                      A website acts as a platform that can shape a favourable
                      perception of your business in a way that social media cannot
                      provide. In particular, protecting yourself from being reviewed
                      unknowingly and/or negatively from damaging and hostile
                      comments.<br />
                      79% of users who read online reviews, believe them. Reduce that
                      negativity by posting your positive testimonials.
                    </p>

                    <h2>3. Easy to start.</h2>
                    <p>
                      You do not need to be tech literate; we can design and put your
                      web page out there, so you can focus on running your day to day
                      operations. We are here to help optimize content clearly and
                      concisely for your target clients.
                    </p>

                    <h2>4. Instant credibility.</h2>
                    <p>
                      First impressions count, and websites allow you to make a very
                      strong impression with a well-designed introduction to your
                      business. A good website instantly boosts your credibility as a
                      genuine business. This means people will be more willing to engage
                      with you.
                    </p>

                    <h2>5. You will save time.</h2>
                    <p>
                      Engaging with potential customers takes time: introducing your
                      business, offering product lists and advantages of your product
                      will take valuable time. Your website can save you that time by
                      providing answers to common customer questions and queries. This
                      means you can spend more time attending to about-to-be-buyers and
                      less time with clients who are browsing or 'window-shopping'.
                    </p>

                    <h2>6. 24hrs Around the clock.</h2>
                    <p>
                      The internet allows consumers to shop online around-the-clock. The
                      only way businesses can reach all of their potential customers is
                      to have a good business web design that will allow them to shop or
                      research the company any hour of the day. Imagine prospective
                      clients reading your web content overnight while we are all
                      sleeping - this would not be possible without a website.
                    </p>

                    <h2>7. Attract new customers.</h2>
                    <p>
                      One of the top reasons for professional web design is the
                      potential to attract new customers. As consumers surf the
                      internet, they will have access to the businesses products,
                      services or information, where otherwise they may not have even
                      known the business existed. You may find prospects in multiple
                      stages of the sales process, meaning you may find researchers,
                      comparers or purchasers. Make sure to have an offer for all of
                      them.
                    </p>

                    <h2>8. Showcase your products.</h2>
                    <p>
                      A well designed and information-filled website will effectively
                      put all your products and services in a controlled and favourable
                      light. It will create awareness for your product or brand which
                      the reader has never tried or heard of before. Your website will
                      bring legitimacy to your service and eliminate the 'fake' or not
                      genuine perception.
                    </p>

                    <h2>9. Further reach.</h2>
                    <p>
                      Your physical presence may be local, but your well-made web page
                      can help your products and services be known provincially,
                      nationally or even globally.
                    </p>

                    <h2>10. It is greener.</h2>
                    <p>
                      For the environmentally conscious, the website reduces human
                      kinds' carbon foot print. People don't need to drive their
                      vehicles to research your business. Businesses spend less money on
                      printed material and flyers. Let's save and protect our trees by
                      doing our part.
                    </p>

                    <h2>11. Improve customer service</h2>
                    <p>
                      A website is a fantastic avenue to provide value-added service to
                      your customers and clients and is an amazing way to keep them
                      coming back to you when they need your products or services.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Build rapport and goodwill: you can share tips with your customers
                      on how to use or care for the products they’ve purchased from you.
                      If it is pharmaceutical products, you can provide tips on dosage,
                      nutrition, rest, to effect optimal recovery for their customers.
                      <br />

                      If you offer a service, such as accounting, you can provide your
                      clients with valuable advice to help them pay less tax at tax time
                      or how to simplify their bookkeeping. Or if you’re in insurance,
                      you could advice on how to choose the right insurance policy for
                      theirs or their family’s needs. <br />
                      <br />
                      By adding a resource section(FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions),
                      you can regularly add articles to answer all your customers’
                      questions and you can keep them better informed and up-to-date.
                    </p>
